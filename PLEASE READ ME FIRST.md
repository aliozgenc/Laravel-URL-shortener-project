Hello BozBoz,
First of all i want to thank you for this opportunity.
Due to technical difficulities i had (had to switched to Mac environment -which i have no experience with- from Windows) i can send this project with back-end only.
I think i did a nice little url-shortener app, you can open in any computer, VPS etc as long as laravel and composer installed.
I didn't used any 3rd party extensions.
I also did the Latest Shortened URLs section. It also shows the original URL.
I searched a few tutorials about how to do a URL shortener as i had no idea and went from there.
It's a basic MVC project but i really enjoyed and felt challenged whilst doing it.

Again, thank you for this opportunity and looking forward to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,

Ali Ozgenc
